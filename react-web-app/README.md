# Overview

This is a project which features a Web App with different posts which lets the user to like and comment any post. The comment section shows when the user clicks on the comment button.

It is a single page which interaction and the content is mostly created for computers, latops or devices with a large screen. To test it, simply download the repository and run the app.

I wrote this code to show my ability to design, style and create a webpage built in one of the best known front-end frameworks for web development.

In my youtube video I go over the components that the page is made out of and how they work.

# Web Pages

I created the Web App with just one page because it is just showing a small part of what can be done with React. I plan on doing a second page in order to show more features and uses of this framework.

# Development Environment
