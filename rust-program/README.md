# Overview

I wrote a simple Rust program which shows the main features of this programming language. The program consist on simple examples of mutable and immutable variables, functions, expressions, conditionals and loops.

The purpose of writting this program is to demonstrate my skills in Rust. I have learned Rust over the past two weeks and I am comfortable with the features it offers. I link the video demonstration that I recorded in order to explain basic concepts of Rust and how the program works.

# Development Environment

I used VSCode, Rust, dependencies from Visual Studio and C++.

* VSCode v1.79.2
* Rust v1.90.0
* Cargo
* Visual Studio C++ Build Tools

# Future Work

- Implement more types of data structures
- Add more games to make use of common data structures, expressions and algorithms
- Use more examples to show the performance difference between Rust and other programming languages.
