This is a program written in Python which displays "Hello World!" in the terminal.

I used the lattest version of Python and Visual Studio Code. 

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate my knowledge in Python.

# Development Environment

{Describe the tools that you used to develop the software}
* Visual Studio Code (v 1.77.3)
* Python (v 3.11.3)

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together.
