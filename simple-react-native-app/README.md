# Overview

This app is a single screen which displays examples of the basic components from React-Native. 

React Native is a well-known framework used to build mobile apps which use native features from smartphones. I built an app that examplifies the main components from this popular framework. I also recorded a video going through a demo of the app and explaining the code behind it.
