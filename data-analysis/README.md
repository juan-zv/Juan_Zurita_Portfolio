# Overview

In this project, I used a data set from Kaggle which has sample data from ficticious individuals and their annual income. This data is meant to train ML algorithms but I used it to work on data anaysis with pandas. I also used a grphic representation tool for this data which is matplotlib. In this code that I wrote I show my abilities to analyze data and be able to process information given by data sets.
